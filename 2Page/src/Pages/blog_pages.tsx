                The world is embracing a lot of robotics. What started as
                automation is now advancing into smart robots. The robots can
                perform tasks beyond what a mechanical system like a conveyor
                belt can handle. As industries and institutions appreciate the
                role of automation, they are embracing robotics easily. Beyond
                the traditional industries that relied on robotics and
                automation, new ones are emerging. The development is supported
                by AI technology. Artificial intelligence helps the robot to
                make own decisions on the direction to move, speed, and action
                to take at each moment. Since the robot is a one-time
                acquisition, it is replacing most of the workers. As the demand
                for robots grows, more people will be required to develop their
                software, maintain the robots, and design them for this growing
                market. These opportunities are available in employment as well
                as entrepreneurship.

                #1. Robotics is a multidisciplinary course
              </h3>
              <p className="text-md leading-8 my-5">
                Robotics goes beyond the science of mechanical engineering. The
                field is open to programmers, graphics designers, body
                designers, and electronic engineers, among other disciplines.
                The beauty and effectiveness of a robot is not restricted to its
                inner workings. As a multidisciplinary area, it accommodates
                professionals from diverse fields. You will be working in a
                multi-disciplinary environment, making your everyday work
                interesting. At the same time, your skills are needed to make
                the robots more efficient. Such work environments are motivating
                and enjoyable. You will easily build a solid and dynamic career
                working in the robotics industry.

                Robots are changing the world in a big way. They are going to
                places where humans are afraid of getting. For instance, they
                can rescue people or explore deep sea areas without the dangers
                that humans would face. At a production plant, a robot will
                significantly cut the cost of production by increasing speed and
                efficiency. The impact of robots is, therefore, extensive.

                Science-based courses are considered difficult, especially for
                girls. They also appear to be preserves of an elite club. You
                can take robotics to prove a point, and especially demystify
                notions around sciences and robotics. Robots have also been
                accused of performing the most heinous acts like murder. Once
                you get to the profession you will realize the positive impact
                robots have had on humanity. It is time someone who understands
                the industry spoke on its behalf. The beauty of robotics is that
                you can see the work of your hands. You produce a robot with a
                particular capability and can see it transforming operations at
                a factory or institution. Robotics is interesting, practical,
                and transformational. And who would not want to join one of the
                most lucrative careers of the future?
